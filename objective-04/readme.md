## Noticing a conflict

(Pic of conflict in github)

The red text indicates the branch cannot automatically be merged.

Git is comparing your changes to its historical origins. 
That is to say it compares what was and what is, both according to your branch.
But if "what was" has now changed, say by someone else's hand,
then git flags this as a `merge conflict`, and doesn't let you merge your branch until it's resolved.
