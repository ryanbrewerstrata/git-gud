# Objective 4: Restore Old Code
#### Rough Draft Notes for this objective
* discuss squashing? The beauty of helpful commit messages.
* Finding a working version through helpful log messages
* The idea of main, and tags.
* The camp that says CI/CD, don't branch--but that's for another time.
 

## General Brainstorming
 * Can I create a GitHub Action users can invoke that forces a Conflict?
 * Put each Objective into its own HTML file. Have a menu for users to click to it.
 * Host this tutorial on GitHub Pages.
 * Do the commands in a callout, like that Rust guy does.
