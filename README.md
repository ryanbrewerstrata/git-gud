# Git Gud

*A Need-to-Know Guide to GitHub for the Non Engineer.*


## Why do I Need to Know about GitHub?

GitHub lets teams create and manage modern software projects. 
It uses a "version control" technology called `git`.

With GitHub, you can version your software, manage access, 
create backups, and restore previous versions.

Without it, team members quarrel over when something changed, 
or muse forgetfully over when it all worked.

Chaos we need not endure!


## How can I use this guide?

Click into the objective folders in this project!
If you're reading this on GitHub, you'll automatically see the `readme.md` file printed on screen.
Read that, then complete the exercises.
