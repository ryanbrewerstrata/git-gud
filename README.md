# Git Gud

*A Need-to-Know Guide to GitHub for the Non Engineer.*


## Why Learn Git & GitHub?

GitHub lets teams create and manage modern software projects. 
It uses a "version control" technology called `git`.

With GitHub, you can version your software, manage access, 
create backups, and restore previous versions.

Without it, team members quarrel over when something changed, 
or muse forgetfully over when it all worked.

Chaos we need not endure!
